> Come From Open Source, Back to Open Source

LangManus is a community-driven AI automation framework that builds upon the incredible work of the open source community. Our goal is to combine language models with specialized tools for tasks like web search, crawling, and Python code execution, while giving back to the community that made this possible.

## Demo

**Task**: Calculate the influence index of DeepSeek R1 on HuggingFace. This index can be designed using a weighted sum of factors such as followers, downloads, and likes.

**LangManus's Fully Automated Plan and Solution**:
1. Gather the latest information about "DeepSeek R1", "HuggingFace", and related topics through online searches.
2. Interact with a Chromium instance to visit the HuggingFace official website, search for "DeepSeek R1" and retrieve the latest data, including followers, likes, downloads, and other relevant metrics.
3. Find formulas for calculating model influence using search engines and web scraping.
4. Use Python to compute the influence index of DeepSeek R1 based on the collected data.
5. Present a comprehensive report to the user.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Installation

LangManus leverages [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as its package manager to streamline dependency management.
Follow the steps below to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Step 1: Create and activate a virtual environment through uv
uv python install 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12

source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 2: Install project dependencies
uv sync
```

By completing these steps, you'll ensure your environment is properly configured and ready for development.

### Configuration

LangManus uses a three-tier LLM system with separate configurations for reasoning, basic tasks, and vision-language tasks. Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following environment variables:

```ini
# Reasoning LLM Configuration (for complex reasoning tasks)
REASONING_MODEL=your_reasoning_model
REASONING_API_KEY=your_reasoning_api_key
REASONING_BASE_URL=your_custom_base_url  # Optional

# Basic LLM Configuration (for simpler tasks)
BASIC_MODEL=your_basic_model
BASIC_API_KEY=your_basic_api_key
BASIC_BASE_URL=your_custom_base_url  # Optional

# Vision-Language LLM Configuration (for tasks involving images)
VL_MODEL=your_vl_model
VL_API_KEY=your_vl_api_key
VL_BASE_URL=your_custom_base_url  # Optional

# Tool API Keys
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key  # Optional

# Browser Configuration
CHROME_INSTANCE_PATH=/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome  # Optional, path to Chrome executable
CHROME_HEADLESS=False  # Optional, default is False
CHROME_PROXY_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:10809  # Optional, default is None
CHROME_PROXY_USERNAME=  # Optional, default is None
CHROME_PROXY_PASSWORD=  # Optional, default is None
```

In addition to supporting LLMs compatible with OpenAI, LangManus also supports Azure LLMs. The configuration method is as follows:

```ini
# AZURE LLM Config
AZURE_API_BASE=https://xxxx
AZURE_API_KEY=xxxxx
AZURE_API_VERSION=2023-07-01-preview

# Reasoning LLM (for complex reasoning tasks)
REASONING_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=xxx

# Non-reasoning LLM (for straightforward tasks)
BASIC_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-2024-08-06

# Vision-language LLM (for tasks requiring visual understanding)
VL_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
```

> **Note:**
>
> - The system uses different models for different types of tasks:
>     - Reasoning LLM for complex decision-making and analysis
>     - Basic LLM for simpler text-based tasks
>     - Vision-Language LLM for tasks involving image understanding
> - You can customize the base URLs for all LLMs independently, and you can use LiteLLM's board LLM support by following [this guide](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).
> - Each LLM can use different API keys if needed
> - Jina API key is optional. Provide your own key to access a higher rate limit (get your API key at [jina.ai](https://jina.ai/))
> - Tavily API key is **required**. Tavily search is configured to return a maximum of 5 results by default (get your API key at [app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com/))

You can copy the `.env.example` file as a template to get started:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure Pre-commit Hook

LangManus includes a pre-commit hook that runs linting and formatting checks before each commit. To set it up:

1. Make the pre-commit script executable:

```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
```

2. Install the pre-commit hook:

```bash
ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

The pre-commit hook will automatically:

- Run linting checks (`make lint`)
- Run code formatting (`make format`)
- Add any reformatted files back to staging
- Prevent commits if there are any linting or formatting errors

## Usage

### Basic Execution

To run LangManus with default settings:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### API Server

LangManus provides a FastAPI-based API server with streaming support:

```bash
# Start the API server
make serve

# Or run directly
uv run server.py
```

The API server exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/chat/stream`: Chat endpoint for LangGraph invoke with streaming support
    - Request body:
  ```json
  {
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Your query here" }],
    "debug": false
  }
  ```
    - Returns a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream with the agent's responses

### Advanced Configuration

LangManus can be customized through various configuration files in the `src/config` directory:

- `env.py`: Configure LLM models, API keys, and base URLs
- `tools.py`: Adjust tool-specific settings (e.g., Tavily search results limit)
- `agents.py`: Modify team composition and agent system prompts

### Agent Prompts System

LangManus uses a sophisticated prompting system in the `src/prompts` directory to define agent behaviors and responsibilities:

#### Core Agent Roles

- **Supervisor ([`src/prompts/supervisor.md`](src/prompts/supervisor.md))**: Coordinates the team and delegates tasks by analyzing requests and determining which specialist should handle them. Makes decisions about task completion and workflow transitions.

- **Researcher ([`src/prompts/researcher.md`](src/prompts/researcher.md))**: Specializes in information gathering through web searches and data collection. Uses Tavily search and web crawling capabilities while avoiding mathematical computations or file operations.

- **Coder ([`src/prompts/coder.md`](src/prompts/coder.md))**: Professional software engineer role focused on Python and bash scripting. Handles:

    - Python code execution and analysis
    - Shell command execution
    - Technical problem-solving and implementation

- **File Manager ([`src/prompts/file_manager.md`](src/prompts/file_manager.md))**: Handles all file system operations with a focus on properly formatting and saving content in markdown format.

- **Browser ([`src/prompts/browser.md`](src/prompts/browser.md))**: Web interaction specialist that handles:
    - Website navigation
    - Page interaction (clicking, typing, scrolling)
    - Content extraction from web pages

#### Prompt System Architecture

The prompts system uses a template engine ([`src/prompts/template.py`](src/prompts/template.py)) that:

- Loads role-specific markdown templates
- Handles variable substitution (e.g., current time, team member information)
- Formats system prompts for each agent

Each agent's prompt is defined in a separate markdown file, making it easy to modify behavior and responsibilities without changing the underlying code.

## Docker

LangManus can be run in a Docker container. default serve api on port 8000.

Before run docker, you need to prepare environment variables in `.env` file.
